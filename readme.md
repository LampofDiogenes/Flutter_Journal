# **Journal Application - Flutter**

# Overview
___
This Application is developed in order to help students understand the process by which programs can be made.
This Application is going to be 1 of 3 made. The other two will also be creating a journal, but will be coded in different languages. 

# Requirements:
__

1.) The App will pull from the same repository as the other 3 applications

2.) The App will be a mobile application

3.) The App will be based on the same designs as the other 3 applications


# Aim for Project
___

The Overarching Goal for this project is:

1.) to understand how to set up the environment (to compare to other languages)

2.) find resources and tool that may help future students in the language

3.) figure out how difficult the learning curve of the language is

4.) find how difficult it is to maintain the project

5.) find any "Gotchas" or easy fixes to common issues

6.) find how long it might take to incorporate device peripherals (other devices that enhance the utility of the application)


My aim for this project as a developer is to be able to learn how web application function. Flutter is interesting, as it loads the calculation alongside the UI. As I code this project, I predict that I will be able to learn more about how the relationship between UI and the logic of software works.
